* JavaScript Simple Quiz

Created a simple application - quiz.

- Used the 'hide' classes to append to pages taht I want to hide-display in a sertaing moment/case.

- Created a button for each answer option and used objects to crete answers/options.

- Added event listeners to check if the answer is correct on a click of a button.

- Creted a timer that deducts the time by 5sec if the answer was incorrect.

- Creted a high score table and the initial submittion form taht stores the data in the local storage.
